# Task 5

Add a new migration to your Todo application that adds a new column to the `todos` table – for example, `priority`, an enum (enumeration of options) with values `normal`, `low`, and `high`.

> ⚠️ Do not modify the existing migration.

At the same time, display this new column in the following places:

- in the **list of todos**,
- in the **todo detail view**,
- and allow editing it from the **todo detail view** (either via a new form or by extending the existing form for editing the title).
